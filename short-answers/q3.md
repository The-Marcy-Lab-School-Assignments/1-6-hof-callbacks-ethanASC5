# Question
What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1,2,3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer
after the .foreach on line 7 the "printdouble" shouldln't be in the yellow parentheses 

# Teacher Feedback

The parenthesis may be yellow on your end due to your specific theme however you are incorrect, the function printDouble actually is exactly where it needs to be to be considered a callback function. What is wrong about the way we are using it?
