# Question
What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1,2,3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer
after the .foreach on line 7 the "printdouble" shouldln't be in the yellow parentheses 


Revised**

-Worded this wrong meant to say the purple paraentheses shouldn't be there because you want printDouble itself as a callback so it can execute for each element in the array.
